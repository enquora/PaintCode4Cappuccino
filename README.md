# PaintCode2Cappuccino

PaintCode2Cappuccino is a simple shell script (with some sed/perl) magic which "transpiles" Objective-C StyeKit files generated by [PaintCode](http://www.paintcodeapp.com/) into Objective-J/Cappuccino files.

Some of the generated files might need some manual changes afterwards. But most don't! :-)

## Installation

Clone this repository and copy `StyleKitMock.j` into you Cappuccino app directory. `StyleKitMock.l` contains some methods/classes which might be used by the code generated by PaintCode.

## Usage

    $ ./convert.sh MyObjCPaintCodeStyleKit.m > MyObjJPaintCodeStyleKit.j
